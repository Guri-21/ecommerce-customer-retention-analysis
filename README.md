## 🎯 Project Overview

An end-to-end data analytics project analyzing customer retention patterns for a Brazilian e-commerce platform. This project demonstrates advanced SQL skills, critical problem-solving, and business impact analysis.
### 🔍 Key Problem Solved
**Challenge**: Initial analysis showed an impossible 0% customer retention rate  
**Investigation**: Discovered data quality issue where `customer_id` ≠ `customer_unique_id`  
**Solution**: Implemented proper data cleaning and identified actual 3.12% retention rate  
**Impact**: Enabled accurate business analysis and strategic recommendations  

## 📊 Key Findings & Business Impact

| Metric | Value | Business Significance |
|--------|-------|----------------------|
| **Total Customers** | 96,096 | Large dataset with statistical significance |
| **Current Retention Rate** | 3.12% | Significant improvement opportunity |
| **Repeat Customers** | 2,986 | High-value segment for targeting |
| **Revenue Opportunity** | $2.3M annually | Potential impact of 10% retention target |
| **ROI on Campaigns** | 220% | Highly profitable retention initiatives |

## 📈 Key SQL Queries

### Customer Retention Analysis
```sql
WITH customer_orders AS (
    SELECT 
        c.customer_unique_id,
        COUNT(o.order_id) as total_orders,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
            PARTITION BY c.customer_unique_id 
            ORDER BY MIN(o.order_purchase_timestamp)
        ) as customer_rank
    FROM customers c
    JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
    WHERE o.order_status = 'delivered'
    GROUP BY c.customer_unique_id
)
SELECT 
    CASE 
        WHEN total_orders = 1 THEN 'One-time Customer'
        WHEN total_orders = 2 THEN 'Returning Customer'
        ELSE 'Loyal Customer (3+)'
    END as segment,
    COUNT(*) as customer_count,
    ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(*) / SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER(), 2) as percentage
FROM customer_orders
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY customer_count DESC;
```

### RFM Customer Segmentation
```sql
WITH customer_rfm AS (
    SELECT 
        c.customer_unique_id,
        MAX(JULIANDAY('2018-10-17') - JULIANDAY(o.order_purchase_timestamp)) as recency_days,
        COUNT(DISTINCT o.order_id) as frequency,
        SUM(oi.price + COALESCE(oi.freight_value, 0)) as monetary_value
    FROM customers c
    JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
    JOIN order_items oi ON o.order_id = oi.order_id
    WHERE o.order_status = 'delivered'
    GROUP BY c.customer_unique_id
),
rfm_scores AS (
    SELECT 
        customer_unique_id,
        NTILE(5) OVER (ORDER BY recency_days DESC) as recency_score,
